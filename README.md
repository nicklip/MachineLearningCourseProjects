###_Machine Learning Course at CSU East Bay_

These are the two projects that I did in the machine learning course I took in graduate school. Included are the project 1 instuctions and the csv files for both project 1 and 2 (1987.csv for project 1 and train.csv & test.csv for project 2). Project 2 was part of the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" Kaggle competition. [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) is a link to the Kaggle page describing the problem.

Both of the projects are implemented in R, as the entire course was taught using R. 

This course covered the following topics:  
* Feature Scaling   
* R Programming   
* K-NN  
* Naive Bayes and text classification  
* Decision Trees and Rules  
* Sparce Matrices  
* Linear Regression  
* Regression Trees and Model Trees  
* Model Evaluation  
* Artificial Neural Networks  
* Support Vector Machines (SVMs)  
* Regularization  
* Parallel Processing  
* Parameter Tuning  
* Boosting, Bagging, and Ensembles  
* Affinity Analysis and Association Rules  
* Clustering and K-Means  
* Cross-validation
